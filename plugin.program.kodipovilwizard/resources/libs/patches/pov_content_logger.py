pov_content_logger.py
Engine V2 decoupled patch module — Content Logger (telemetry) feature.

ARCHITECTURE
------------
Native POV code wraps entire item-building loops in a bare `except: pass`.
Engine V2 forbids removing or rewriting that except clause, so we can't
catch-and-log from the inside.

Instead we use Python's own low-level exception hook: `sys.settrace` /
`threading.settrace`. Once a trace function is installed, Python calls it
with event == 'exception' the moment an exception is raised in a traced
frame — this fires BEFORE the enclosing except clause runs, regardless of
whether that clause ends up swallowing it. No monkey-patching of
self.append, no global state dicts, no success/failure inference.

We scope the tracer tightly (enable at the top of run(), disable at the
bottom) so the overhead only exists while POV is actually building a
directory listing, not for the lifetime of the Python process.

`threading.settrace` is required in addition to `sys.settrace` because
POV builds items in worker threads (via TaskPool -> Thread); sys.settrace
alone only affects the thread that calls it, and only for frames entered
after the call. threading.settrace propagates the tracer to any thread
started after it's set, which is why we enable it before self.worker()
spawns its Thread pool.
