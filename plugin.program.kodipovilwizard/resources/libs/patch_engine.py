#  KODI-POV-IL - Engine v2 Runtime Patching Architecture
#
#  A metadata-driven source patcher. Every entry in
#  resources.libs.patches.patches_config.PATCH_CONFIG describes a single
#  surgical edit to apply to an installed addon's source file: WHERE to make
#  it (addon_id + target_file + anchor), WHAT to inject (hook), and HOW to
#  version/roll it forward (id + marker).
#
#  This lets us ship, upgrade, and roll back in-place code patches to
#  third-party/downstream addons (plugin.video.pov and friends) purely by
#  publishing an updated patches_config.py -- no wizard redeploy, no addon
#  redeploy, no user action.
#
#  DESIGN GOALS (all enforced below):
#    1. NEVER raise. A malformed patch entry, a missing addon, a missing
#       file, a missing anchor, or a corrupt existing patch block must only
#       ever be logged and skipped -- boot must always continue.
#    2. Idempotent. Running this 50 times in a row on an already-patched
#       device is a silent, instant no-op.
#    3. Self-healing / upgradeable. Bumping a patch's `marker` (e.g. _v1 ->
#       _v2) automatically scrubs the stale block and re-injects the new one
#       on the next run, with the file's `id` tag staying constant across
#       every version so the block is always findable.
#    4. Active Scrubbing. Disabling a patch (either in config or via Kodi UI
#       settings) actively removes the injected code on the next run.
#    5. Cheap on flash. Each physical target file is read once and written
#       once per run, no matter how many patches target it.
