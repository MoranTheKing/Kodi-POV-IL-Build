# Background daemon: prune the translation cache on Kodi start, then
# again every 24h while Kodi is running. Lightweight -- one stat
# pass over a small directory and we're done. Exits if Kodi tells
# us to shut down via Monitor.abortRequested().
#
# Everything is wrapped in try/except so a bug here can't take
# the rest of Kodi down with it.
#
# First-run disable: if a `.disable_on_first_run` marker file is
# present in the addon's directory (placed there by the rollout-1
# quick_update patch), this daemon disables itself the moment it
# wakes up and removes the marker. That way existing users get the
# addon installed but inactive, so they can review before opting in.
# Fresh Install builds never ship the marker, so they rely on Kodi's
# default "new user addons start disabled" behaviour.

    # update startup freezes") when this tuple had TWENTY-SIX entries -- 6.5
    # seconds of yielding, which is what that change was tested at. It has 63
    # now, so the same line costs 15.75 seconds of pure sleeping on every boot
    # before a single step does any work, and nobody re-derived it as steps
    # were added. Two independent reviews measured it; one field log shows the
    # pass still running 53 seconds in.
    #
    # What the wait is FOR is not starving Kodi while the pass runs, and that
    # is a property of the total time yielded, not of the per-step figure. So
    # spread the same total the original was validated at over however many
    # steps there are. A short pass is unchanged (the cap is the old value), a
    # long one stops paying for its own length, and step 64 costs nothing.
    # THE FLOOR IS A SECOND CONSTRAINT, and it wins. Below ~130 steps the
    # budget binds and the pass yields 6.5s in total however long the tuple
    # gets. Above that the floor binds instead and the total starts growing
    # again -- which is correct, because a yield of nothing is not a yield and
    # the freeze this line exists to prevent would come back. It is also the
    # signal that the answer has stopped being "tune the constant": a pass that
    # long wants splitting, not a smaller sleep. So it says so, once, instead
    # of quietly costing seconds again the way 0.25 did.

#     be re-derived, not inherited.
#   * _publish_repairs_state / REPAIRS_DONE_PROPERTY is what the wizard's

    And the add-on builds that url itself: Kan's mobile API returns a BARE id

    fails to unwrap its own construction. This is not a regression and not
    something Kan changed -- every Kan item of that type has always failed.

    The injected line only fires where the add-on produced something that
    cannot be a YouTube id (eleven characters of YouTube's own charset), which

    The startup mirror covers most of it, but POV refreshes its token
    silently in the background -- with its own client_id, the only one that
    can -- and a set-top box stays on for days. Once POV rotates the token,
    the copy Umbrella reads from disk is stale, so the next Umbrella session
    authenticates with a dead token. Umbrella also fixes its Authorization
    header at module-import time and reuses its interpreter, so there is no
    way to hand it a new token mid-session; what matters is that the value on
    disk is right BEFORE it next imports.

    A periodic re-mirror is two settings reads and writes only on a change,
    so it costs nothing to run often. Deliberately NOT a patch to POV's own
    mdbl_refresh(): another injection into somebody else's file, to achieve
    what a cheap poll already achieves, is surface area for no gain.

    Every minute, not every quarter of an hour, and that is what makes a
    fresh connect land. MDBList gets an instant push -- POV's Connect
    Services row fires our mirror the moment it returns -- but Trakt has no
    such hook, and wiring one means wrapping another class on the screen
    that takes the whole of Connect Services down if it raises. A minute of
    lag is worth more than that risk. In the steady state a pass is a
    handful of getSetting calls and no writes at all.

    MDBLIST BEFORE TRAKT, and the startup pass in _maybe_patch_umbrella_

    THIS USED TO NAME ONE SKIN. It gated on `getSkinDir() != 'skin.fentastic'`
    and returned otherwise, so it only ever reached FENtastic users -- while
    skin.povil.nox ships the identical feature (same `OSDAutoClose` /
    `OSDAutoCloseTime` settings, same Timers.xml `autoclosevideoosd` timer),
    also off by default. Every Nox user has had the bar stay up since the
    feature shipped, and that is what the report was.

    So it detects the CAPABILITY instead of matching a name: if the active
    skin's own XML declares OSDAutoClose, it supports it. AF3 and Estuary do
    not and are skipped without a list saying so.

    Seeding is recorded IN THE SKIN's settings, not ours. That matters both
    ways: the mark is per-skin for free, so switching to a skin that has never
    been seeded seeds it; and if a skin is reinstalled or its settings are
    reset, our mark disappears with them and the default is re-seeded. A
    deliberate opt-out AFTER seeding is left alone, because the mark is still
    there. An add-on-side marker could do neither -- which is how one lost
    write became permanent.

    The one population the skin-side mark cannot describe is the users the OLD
    migration already reached: FENtastic users carrying `_fen_osd_autoclose_v1`
    have been seeded, but on the add-on side, where the new code cannot see it.
    Treating them as unseeded would re-enable the setting for anyone who turned
    it back off on purpose, so that marker is read once and converted into the
    skin-side mark WITHOUT rewriting the values. It is the same promise the old
    marker made, kept in the new place.

    The mark is a skin BOOL, and that is not a stylistic choice. Kodi keeps
    skin bools and skin strings in two separate maps (CSkinInfo::m_bools and
    m_strings, each with its own name->id table), and `Skin.HasSetting` is
    wired to the bool one. A mark written with Skin.SetString is invisible to
    it -- the guard would read false forever and this migration would re-force
    the values on EVERY boot, which is the opposite of leaving an opt-out
    alone. _maybe_default_nox_poster_rating pairs them correctly; so does this.

    "POV is off" has two causes and this could not tell them apart, so it

    words: "re-enabling something somebody turned off by hand is not ours to
    do". This now honours the same rule.

    So it acts only on evidence. pov_reload writes a record before it disables
    POV and clears it only once POV can be constructed again; that record, and
